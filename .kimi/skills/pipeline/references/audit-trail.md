# Audit Trail Reference

> **SSOT** for the operational audit mechanics: Phase Transition Summary block template and Gate Decision Log JSONL format. Gate definitions (Hardness Taxonomy + Registry) are in `references/gates.md`. `commands/pipeline.md` Grep-redirects here for the transition and log formats.

## Phase Transition Summary (MANDATORY)

**Before transitioning from one phase to the next**, emit a Phase Transition Summary block. This provides visibility into what happened in the completed phase and what carries forward.

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  PHASE TRANSITION: [N] → [N+1]                                  ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  Phase [N] Summary:                                              ║
║    [✓|✗|○] [Agent/Step]: [status]                                ║
║    [✓|✗|○] [Agent/Step]: [status]                                ║
║  Gates triggered: [N] ([list with hardness])                     ║
║  Gates skipped: [N] ([list — SOFT only])                         ║
║  Confidence: [score or N/A]                                      ║
║  Carry-forward: [list of artifacts passed to next phase]         ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**Symbols:** `✓` = success, `✗` = failed, `○` = skipped/not triggered

**Rules:**
1. Emit BEFORE every phase transition. Possible transitions: `0→1`, then either `1→1.5→2` (if planning runs) or `1→2` (if planning is skipped), then `2→3`. These are mutually exclusive paths — emit only the transitions that actually occur
2. List every gate that was triggered with its hardness level
3. List every SOFT gate that was skipped (for audit trail)
4. Include confidence score if available
5. List exact artifacts being passed to the next phase

---

## Gate Decision Log (MANDATORY)

Every gate decision MUST be appended to `{PIPELINE_DOC_PATH}/gate-decisions.jsonl`. This is a machine-readable audit trail.

**Format (one JSON object per line):**

```jsonl
{"gate":"INFO_GATE_BLOCKED","hardness":"HARD","phase":0,"decision":"RESOLVED","decided_by":"user","timestamp":"2026-03-29T14:30:00","detail":"2 gaps answered","confidence_impact":0.0}
{"gate":"TDD_APPROVAL","hardness":"HARD","phase":2,"decision":"APPROVED","decided_by":"user","timestamp":"2026-03-29T14:45:00","detail":"3 scenarios approved","confidence_impact":0.0}
{"gate":"ADVERSARIAL_GATE","hardness":"SOFT","phase":2,"decision":"SKIPPED","decided_by":"user","timestamp":"2026-03-29T15:00:00","detail":"user chose to skip batch 1 review","confidence_impact":-0.10}
```

**Fields:**
- `gate`: Gate name from the Gate Registry (see `references/gates.md`)
- `hardness`: MANDATORY | HARD | CIRCUIT_BREAKER | SOFT
- `phase`: Phase number where gate was triggered (0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3)
- `decision`: RESOLVED | APPROVED | BLOCKED | SKIPPED | STOPPED | FAILED
- `decided_by`: `user` (explicit user response via AskUserQuestion) | `system` (pipeline controller enforced — e.g., MANDATORY gates, CIRCUIT_BREAKER triggers) | `auto` (automatic resolution without user interaction — e.g., info-gate self-answered from code)
- `timestamp`: ISO 8601
- `detail`: Human-readable summary
- `confidence_impact`: Numeric impact on confidence score (negative = reduces confidence)

**Rules:**
1. EVERY gate trigger MUST be logged — no exceptions
2. The file is append-only during a pipeline run
3. `final-validator` MUST read this file to factor skipped gates into the decision
4. SOFT gates skipped carry `confidence_impact: -0.10` by default (ADVERSARIAL_GATE: -0.15, FINAL_ADVERSARIAL_GATE: -0.15, CLOSEOUT_CONFIRM: -0.05)
5. MANDATORY/HARD gates cannot have `decision: "SKIPPED"`
6. **Controller-only writes:** Only the pipeline controller appends to this file. Subagents report gate outcomes in structured YAML; the controller serializes them. This eliminates injection surface at the file level
7. **Sanitization:** The `detail` field MUST be truncated to 200 characters and stripped of newline characters (`\n`, `\r`) before serialization. Entries MUST be written via a strict JSON serializer, never via string interpolation
8. **Parse-time validation (final-validator):** Each line MUST parse as a single valid JSON object with exactly these keys: `gate`, `hardness`, `phase`, `decision`, `decided_by`, `timestamp`, `detail`, `confidence_impact`. Lines that fail to parse or contain unexpected keys MUST be flagged as anomalous and reported to the user. The `hardness` value MUST match the Gate Registry in `references/gates.md` for the named `gate` — mismatches indicate tampering

## Verdict vs Gate Decision Vocabulary

> Disambiguates two distinct decision vocabularies in the pipeline. This section was added in v4.11.0 (Wave 3-spec) to resolve confusion flagged in Wave 2 adversarial review where reviewers conflated final-validator verdicts (`GO/CONDITIONAL/NO-GO`) with gate states (`PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED/...`).

### Two distinct vocabularies

| Vocabulary | Producer | Values | Where it appears |
|------------|----------|--------|------------------|
| **Pipeline Verdict** | `final-validator` ONLY | `GO` \| `CONDITIONAL` \| `NO-GO` | Pipeline output FINAL DECISION line; pipeline summary block |
| **Gate Decision** | Each gate (16+ gates) | `PASS` \| `FAIL` \| `SKIPPED` \| `RESOLVED` \| `APPROVED` \| `BLOCKED` \| `STOPPED` \| `RESET` | `gate-decisions.jsonl` (one per gate trigger); audit trail entries |

### Cross-reference table

| Producer | Vocabulary | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| `task-orchestrator` | n/a (emits ORCHESTRATOR_DECISION YAML, no verdict) | — |
| `information-gate` | Gate Decision (RESOLVED \| BLOCKED) | Logs to gate-decisions.jsonl |
| `quality-gate-router` | Gate Decision (APPROVED) | TDD_APPROVAL gate |
| `executor-controller` | Gate Decision (PASS \| FAIL per checkpoint) | CHECKPOINT_FAIL gate |
| `adversarial-review-coordinator` | Gate Decision (PASS \| BLOCKED) | ADVERSARIAL_BLOCK / ADVERSARIAL_GATE |
| `spec-format-gate` | Gate Decision (GO \| GO-WARN \| NO-GO mapped to PASS \| PASS \| FAIL) | SPEC_FORMAT_GATE_FAIL gate |
| `spec-content-reviewer` | Gate Decision (GO \| NO-GO mapped to PASS \| FAIL) | SPEC_CONTENT_REVIEW_NOGO gate |
| `spec-post-impl-validator` | Gate Decision (PASS \| FAIL) | SPEC_POST_IMPL_FAIL gate |
| **`final-validator`** | **Pipeline Verdict (GO \| CONDITIONAL \| NO-GO)** | **Terminal verdict only — never appears in gate-decisions.jsonl** |
| `spec-closer` | n/a (emits `spec_grade` STRING — cosmetic, not a gate decision) | `spec_grade` is a letter grade for closure summary; does NOT replace the final-validator verdict |

### Key rule

`spec_grade` (produced by `spec-closer`) is **cosmetic only** — it's a human-readable letter grade for the closure summary block. It is NEVER a substitute for the pipeline verdict. The `final-validator` GO/CONDITIONAL/NO-GO verdict is what determines whether the pipeline ships.
