description: Prescriptive 11-step bug fix workflow for COMPLEXA bugs and production incidents (cross-cutting concerns, persistence, concurrency, multi-user impact, business rules). Imported from Pulsar bugfix workflow per spec §21. Use when complexity classification is heavy or when bugfix-light auto-escalates at its complexity gate. Steps 1-3 subagent (recon + root-cause + domain truth model), 4 inline gate (controlled change proposal — REQUIRES APPROVAL), 5-6 inline (TDD pre-impl + minimal diff), 7 subagent (sanity + regression), 8 parallel subagents gate (adversarial security+architecture+quality), 9 subagent (post-fix UX E2E), 10 inline gate (Pa de Cal GO/NO-GO), 11 subagent (final after-all sanity sweep). Closes 4 audit gaps Heavy 3 (domain truth model net-new), Heavy 8 (3-way adversarial), Heavy 9 (UX as post-fix E2E), Heavy 11 (after-all distinct from Pa de Cal). Manual-only invocation via /pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:bugfix-heavy or via /pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:bugfix --heavy.

# Bug Fix Heavy Workflow (11 prescriptive steps)

## VISIBLE_PLAN Contract

Before any execution, file edit, dispatch, report generation, validation claim, or terminal response, call `update_plan` so the user sees the workflow plan in Codex. This is mandatory for this workflow and uses `references/visible-plan-contract.md` as the SSOT.

The visible plan must name the selected workflow/mode, declare the planned batches, and track PDD, DDD, ATDD, and TDD or the report-only evidence-first equivalent. Every batch must be followed by checkpoint validation, adversarial review, and a fix loop capped at 3 attempts before continuing. Keep exactly one item `in_progress` and update the plan after every gate, batch, review, correction, and final validation. If the visible plan cannot be opened or updated, stop and surface the blocker instead of proceeding invisibly.

## NEXT_STEP Contract

When this workflow reaches any terminal state, emit the `NEXT_STEP` block defined in `references/workflow-next-step.md`. Use the workflow name from this file's frontmatter as `current_workflow`; if blocked or waiting on the user, point back to the same workflow instead of advancing.

This skill executes a deterministic 11-step procedure for COMPLEXA bugs / production incidents. The procedure is **non-negotiable**: order is locked, execution mode per step is locked, and gates cannot be skipped. The 4 audit gaps from spec §21.2 are closed by net-new step 3 (Domain Truth Model), step 8 (3-way adversarial), refocused step 9 (post-fix UX E2E), and net-new step 11 (final after-all sweep distinct from Pa de Cal).

## When to use this skill

Use **bugfix-heavy** when ANY of the following hold:
- Bug touches more than 2 files OR diff is expected to exceed ~50 lines
- Cross-cutting concerns are involved (persistence, concurrency, multi-user, business rules, source of truth, idempotency, atomicity, cache consistency)
- Bug is a production incident OR has user-visible severity
- Bug is intermittent / non-deterministic / timing-related
- Reproduction requires real services (DB, queues, external APIs)
- `bugfix-light` auto-escalated at its step 7 complexity gate

If none of these hold, prefer `bugfix-light` (8 steps, lighter ceremony).

## Execution rules (8 enforcement rules — non-negotiable)

These rules are baked into the frontmatter contract. The dispatch-guard hook + sentinel-hook validate them at runtime. Violations are blocked deterministically.

1. **Sequence lock** — steps execute strictly in order 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9→10→11. No skip, no reorder. Validated via `sequence:` + `sequence_lock: true` plus `expected_next:` per step.
2. **Execution-mode lock** — each step declares `execution_mode: inline | subagent`. Cannot be swapped at runtime.
3. **Agent-type whitelist** — when `execution_mode: subagent`, the step declares the EXACT `agent_type:` allowed. dispatch-guard rejects any other agent. Step 8 declares `agent_type: parallel` and the body documents the 3-spawn pattern (single message, three Task tool calls in parallel).
4. **Output schema** — each step declares `expected_outputs:`; the next step verifies inputs match before proceeding. Fail-closed.
5. **AskUserQuestion gates obrigatórios** — steps 4, 8, 10 declare `gate_required: true`. The skill MUST invoke AskUserQuestion at those points. Prose substitution is forbidden.
6. **STOP RULE** — 2 consecutive failures (build, test, validation) halt the pipeline. `stop_rule_max_failures: 2` enforced by sanity-checker + checkpoint-validator.
7. **Audit log append-only** — every gate decision, AskUserQuestion answer, step transition, and STOP event is appended to `.pipeline/gate-decisions.jsonl`.
8. **Sentinel checkpoints** — sentinel-hook validates state coherence before steps 4, 8, 10 (`sentinel_checkpoints: [pre_4, pre_8, pre_10]`). Outside these checkpoints, sentinel blocks execution.

## How execution flows

1. The skill is invoked via `/pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:bugfix-heavy "<bug description>"` (or via `/pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:bugfix --heavy` after pipeline-controller dispatch, or via auto-escalation from `bugfix-light` step 7).
2. The orchestrator reads `sequence:` and walks the steps.
3. For each step, the orchestrator opens `steps/0X-*.md`, reads the frontmatter, and:
   - if `execution_mode: inline`, the agent processes the step body in main context using `allowed_tools` from the step
   - if `execution_mode: subagent`, the agent spawns a Task with `agent_type:` and passes `expected_inputs` from previous steps
   - for step 8 (parallel), three Task calls are spawned in a SINGLE message (security-scanner + architecture-critic + quality-reviewer)
4. Outputs accumulate; `expected_next` chains the next step.
5. Gates (steps 4, 8, 10) raise AskUserQuestion before transitioning.
6. On any failure, the STOP RULE may halt the pipeline.

## Gap closures relative to v4.3.1 plugin

- **Heavy 3 — Domain Truth Model (NET-NEW)**: enforced in `steps/03-domain-truth-model.md`. Explicit business rules + source of truth + invariants + property tests + transactional consistency tests BEFORE any code change. v4.3.1 had no equivalent step.
- **Heavy 8 — Adversarial 3-way**: enforced in `steps/08-adversarial-ux-tech-review.md` via three parallel subagents (security-scanner, architecture-critic, quality-reviewer). v4.3.1 had a single-agent adversarial pass; this triples coverage and parallelizes for latency.
- **Heavy 9 — UX as POST-FIX E2E** (refocus): `steps/09-ux-user-journey-e2e.md` is framed as post-fix verification of the user journey end-to-end (mobile-first), NOT generic UX simulation. Confirms the fix from the user's perspective.
- **Heavy 11 — Final Validation After-All (NET-NEW, distinct from Pa de Cal)**: enforced in `steps/11-final-validation-after-all.md`. Step 10 is the GO/NO-GO decision (subjective synthesis). Step 11 is the post-decision sanity sweep (artifacts intact, commits made, branch clean, tests passing on cold checkout). They are distinct phases.
