# review

## VISIBLE_PLAN Contract

As the first assistant action for this workflow, call `update_plan` so the Codex UI opens the visible planning panel before any workflow/method gate, execution, file edit, dispatch, report generation, validation claim, terminal response, or phase transition. This is mandatory for this workflow and uses `references/visible-plan-contract.md` as the SSOT.

The visible plan must name the selected workflow/mode, declare the planned batches, and track PDD, DDD, ATDD, and TDD or the report-only evidence-first equivalent. Every batch must be followed by checkpoint validation, adversarial review, and a fix loop capped at 3 attempts before continuing. Keep exactly one item `in_progress` and update the plan after every gate, batch, review, correction, and final validation. If the visible plan cannot be opened or updated, stop and surface the blocker instead of proceeding invisibly.

## WORKFLOW_METHOD_GATE Contract

Before any execution, dispatch, file edit, report generation, validation claim, terminal response, or phase transition, show the workflow/method gate defined in `references/workflow-method-gate.md` and wait for the user's answer. State the selected workflow/mode, give the practical reason, and allow switching to `audit`, `bugfix`, `feature`, `ux`, `spec`, `brainstorm`, `review`, or `verify-completion` before continuing.

If the user switches workflow, rebuild the gate and ask again. If the gate cannot be shown or the user does not approve, stop before starting the workflow.

## NEXT_STEP Contract

When this workflow reaches any terminal state, emit the `NEXT_STEP` block defined in `references/workflow-next-step.md`. Use the workflow name from this file's frontmatter as `current_workflow`; if blocked or waiting on the user, point back to the same workflow instead of advancing.



## Codex Real-Agent Runtime Contract

Any operational path in this workflow that dispatches pipeline work MUST use real Codex `spawn_agent` with a `PIPELINE_AGENT_FQN` marker. If `spawn_agent` is unavailable, fails, or cannot return an isolated agent result, stop with `blocked-no-agent-runtime`. Do not continue inline, do not simulate subagents, and do not report the run as real multi-agent execution.

If a manual auxiliary review is offered after a runtime block, label it `manual_fallback_not_pipeline` and include exactly: "This is a manual fallback review, not a valid pipeline execution." It never counts as approval, PASS, or a valid pipeline execution.

For informational-only workflows, do not launch the recommended workflow from the help/router context. Recommend the command and stop unless the user explicitly invokes an executable workflow with real agent support.

## Codex Parent Protocol Contract

Codex does not execute Claude-only task or question primitives as the operational contract. Subagent work is dispatched with real `spawn_agent`. User decisions are emitted as `GATE_REQUEST` protocol blocks, answered in the parent context, persisted to `protocol-events.jsonl`, and mirrored to `gate-decisions.jsonl` when the gate is canonical. Malformed or unanswered protocol blocks block the workflow; they are never silently defaulted.

## Overview

This skill performs task-local adversarial review. It verifies that the implementation is real, complete, bounded, aligned with approved requirements and design, and supported by mechanical verification evidence.

Boundary terminology continuity:
- discovery identifies `Boundary Candidates`
- design fixes `Boundary Commitments`
- tasks constrain execution with `_Boundary:_`
- review rejects concrete `Boundary Violations`

## When to Use

- After an implementer reports `READY_FOR_REVIEW`
- After remediation for a rejected review
- Before marking a task `[x]`
- Before accepting a task into feature-level validation

Do not use this skill to invent missing requirements or silently reinterpret the spec.

## Inputs

Provide:
- Task ID and exact task text from `tasks.md`
- Relevant requirement section numbers
- Relevant design section numbers
- Spec file paths (`requirements.md`, `design.md`, optionally `tasks.md`)
- The implementer's status report
- The task `_Boundary:_` scope constraints
- Validation commands discovered by the controller
- Relevant steering excerpts when applicable
- Relevant `## Implementation Notes` entries when applicable

## Outputs

Return one of:
- `APPROVED`
- `REJECTED`

Also return:
- Mechanical results
- Findings with severity
- Required remediation
- One-sentence summary

Use the language specified in `spec.json`.

## First Action

Run `git diff` to inspect the actual code changes. If the diff is large or ambiguous, read the changed files directly. Do not trust the implementer report as source of truth.

## Core Principle

Read the spec yourself. Read the diff yourself. Verify mechanically where possible. Reject on concrete failures rather than interpretive optimism.
The main review question is not just "does it work?" but "does it stay inside the approved responsibility boundary without hiding new coupling?"

## Mechanical Checks

Run these checks and use the result as primary signal.

### 1. Regression Safety
- Run the project's canonical test suite using the validation commands discovered by the controller.
- If tests fail, reject.

### 2. No Residual Placeholder Markers
- Check changed files for `TBD`, `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX`.
- Reject if new placeholder markers were introduced without explicit task justification.

### 3. No Hardcoded Secrets
- Check changed files for hardcoded secrets or credentials.
- Reject if concrete secret patterns are introduced.

### 4. Boundary Respect
- Compare changed files against the task `_Boundary:_` scope.
- Reject if the change spills outside the approved boundary without explicit justification.
- Reject if the implementation introduces hidden cross-boundary coordination inside what should be a local task.

### 5. RED Phase Evidence
- For behavioral tasks, verify that the implementer status report includes `RED_PHASE_OUTPUT`.
- Reject if RED evidence is missing, empty, or unrelated to the task's acceptance criteria.

### 6. Runtime-Sensitive Static Checks
- If the project already has lint or equivalent static analysis for the touched stack, run the relevant command for the task boundary.
- Pay attention to patterns that can survive typecheck/build yet fail at runtime: type-only imports used as values, missing namespace value imports for qualified-name access, unresolved globals, and newly introduced runtime-sensitive dependencies without matching boot/runtime handling.
- If no project lint command exists, perform a targeted diff-based spot check in the changed files for those patterns.
- Reject on concrete findings that create a realistic boot-time or module-load failure.

## Judgment Checks

### 7. Reality Check
- Confirm the implementation is real production code, not a placeholder, stub, fake path, or deferred-work shell.

### 8. Acceptance Criteria Coverage
- Read the task description and confirm all aspects are implemented, not only the primary happy path.

### 9. Requirements Alignment
- Read the referenced sections in `requirements.md`.
- Confirm each requirement is satisfied by concrete observable behavior.
- Use original section numbers only.

### 10. Design Alignment
- Read the referenced sections in `design.md`.
- Confirm the implementation uses the prescribed structures, interfaces, and dependency direction.
- Reject silent substitutions for design-mandated choices.

### 10.5 Boundary Audit
- Compare the implementation against the design's boundary commitments and out-of-boundary statements.
- Reject if downstream-specific behavior is pushed into an upstream boundary for convenience.
- Reject if the implementation creates new hidden dependencies, shared ownership, or undeclared coupling across adjacent boundaries.
- Reject if a task that is not an explicit integration task now behaves like one.

### 11. Test Quality
- Confirm tests prove the required behavior rather than only scaffolding.
- Confirm tests would fail if the implementation were removed or broken.

### 12. Error Handling
- Confirm relevant failure paths are handled and not silently swallowed.

## Severity Model

Use:
- `Critical` for broken functionality, invalid verification, data loss, security risk, or major scope violation
- `Important` for required fixes before acceptance
- `Suggestion` for non-blocking improvements
- `FYI` for informational notes

## Stop / Escalate

Escalate instead of papering over the issue when:
- The approved spec is ambiguous in a correctness-critical way
- The design conflicts with what is technically possible
- Required evidence cannot be gathered
- The implementation only works by silently deviating from approved scope
- Boundary ownership cannot be determined cleanly from requirements, design, and task scope

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| “Tests pass, so approve” | Passing tests do not prove spec compliance or boundary respect. |
| “The extra behavior is useful” | Extra behavior outside approved scope is still drift. |
| “The implementer said RED was done” | RED must be evidenced, not asserted. |
| “This gap is small enough to let through” | Real gaps must be rejected or escalated. |
