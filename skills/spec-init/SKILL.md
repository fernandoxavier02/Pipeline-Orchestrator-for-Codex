# Spec Initialization

## VISIBLE_PLAN Contract

As the first assistant action for this workflow, call `update_plan` so the Codex UI opens the visible planning panel before any workflow/method gate, execution, file edit, dispatch, report generation, validation claim, terminal response, or phase transition. This is mandatory for this workflow and uses `references/visible-plan-contract.md` as the SSOT.

The visible plan must name the selected workflow/mode, declare the planned batches, and track PDD, DDD, ATDD, and TDD or the report-only evidence-first equivalent. Every batch must be followed by checkpoint validation, adversarial review, and a fix loop capped at 3 attempts before continuing. Keep exactly one item `in_progress` and update the plan after every gate, batch, review, correction, and final validation. If the visible plan cannot be opened or updated, stop and surface the blocker instead of proceeding invisibly.

## WORKFLOW_METHOD_GATE Contract

Before any execution, dispatch, file edit, report generation, validation claim, terminal response, or phase transition, show the workflow/method gate defined in `references/workflow-method-gate.md` and wait for the user's answer. State the selected workflow/mode, give the practical reason, and allow switching to `audit`, `bugfix`, `feature`, `ux`, `spec`, `brainstorm`, `review`, or `verify-completion` before continuing.

If the user switches workflow, rebuild the gate and ask again. If the gate cannot be shown or the user does not approve, stop before starting the workflow.

## NEXT_STEP Contract

When this workflow reaches any terminal state, emit the `NEXT_STEP` block defined in `references/workflow-next-step.md`. Use the workflow name from this file's frontmatter as `current_workflow`; if blocked or waiting on the user, point back to the same workflow instead of advancing.

## Core Task
Generate a unique feature name from the project description ($ARGUMENTS) and initialize the specification structure.

## Execution Steps
1. **Check for Brief**: The brainstorm-controller (agents/core/brainstorm-controller.md) handles intake; this skill assumes the prompt is already concrete and skips discovery-style clarification.
2. **Clarify Intent**: The Project Description in requirements.md must contain three elements: (a) who has the problem, (b) current situation, (c) what should change. If a brief.md exists and covers these, skip to step 3. Otherwise, ask the user to clarify before proceeding. Ask as many questions as needed; do not fill in gaps with your own assumptions.
3. **Check Uniqueness**: Verify `pipeline-runs/` for run-id collisions. If the directory already exists with only `brief.md` (no `spec.json`), use that directory (discovery created it).
4. **Create Directory**: `pipeline-runs/<run_id>/01-spec/` (skip if already exists from discovery)
5. **Initialize Files Using Templates**:
   - Read `references/spec-templates/init.json`
   - Read `references/spec-templates/requirements-init.md`
   - Replace placeholders:
     - `{{FEATURE_NAME}}` → generated feature name
     - `{{TIMESTAMP}}` → current ISO 8601 timestamp
     - `{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}` → from brief.md if available, otherwise $ARGUMENTS
     - `pt` → language code (detect from user's input language, default to `en`)
   - Write `spec.json` and `requirements.md` to spec directory

## Important Constraints
- Do NOT generate requirements, design, or tasks. This skill only creates spec.json and requirements.md.
</instructions>

## Output Description
Provide output in the language specified in `spec.json` with the following structure:

1. **Generated Feature Name**: `feature-name` format with 1-2 sentence rationale
2. **Project Summary**: Brief summary (1 sentence)
3. **Created Files**: Bullet list with full paths
4. **Next Step**: Command block showing `/pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:spec-requirements <feature-name>`

**Format Requirements**:
- Use Markdown headings (##, ###)
- Wrap commands in code blocks
- Keep total output concise (under 250 words)
- Use clear, professional language per `spec.json.language`

## Safety & Fallback
- **Ambiguous Feature Name**: If feature name generation is unclear, propose 2-3 options and ask user to select
- **Template Missing**: If template files don't exist in `references/spec-templates/`, report error with specific missing file path and suggest checking repository setup
- **Directory Conflict**: If feature name already exists, append numeric suffix (e.g., `feature-name-2`) and notify user of automatic conflict resolution
- **Write Failure**: Report error with specific path and suggest checking permissions or disk space
