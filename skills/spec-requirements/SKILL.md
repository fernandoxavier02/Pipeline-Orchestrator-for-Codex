## VISIBLE_PLAN Contract

As the first assistant action for this workflow, call `update_plan` so the Codex UI opens the visible planning panel before any workflow/method gate, execution, file edit, dispatch, report generation, validation claim, terminal response, or phase transition. This is mandatory for this workflow and uses `references/visible-plan-contract.md` as the SSOT.

The visible plan must name the selected workflow/mode, declare the planned batches, and track PDD, DDD, ATDD, and TDD or the report-only evidence-first equivalent. Every batch must be followed by checkpoint validation, adversarial review, and a fix loop capped at 3 attempts before continuing. Keep exactly one item `in_progress` and update the plan after every gate, batch, review, correction, and final validation. If the visible plan cannot be opened or updated, stop and surface the blocker instead of proceeding invisibly.

## WORKFLOW_METHOD_GATE Contract

Before any execution, dispatch, file edit, report generation, validation claim, terminal response, or phase transition, show the workflow/method gate defined in `references/workflow-method-gate.md` and wait for the user's answer. State the selected workflow/mode, give the practical reason, and allow switching to `audit`, `bugfix`, `feature`, `ux`, `spec`, `brainstorm`, `review`, or `verify-completion` before continuing.

If the user switches workflow, rebuild the gate and ask again. If the gate cannot be shown or the user does not approve, stop before starting the workflow.

## NEXT_STEP Contract

When this workflow reaches any terminal state, emit the `NEXT_STEP` block defined in `references/workflow-next-step.md`. Use the workflow name from this file's frontmatter as `current_workflow`; if blocked or waiting on the user, point back to the same workflow instead of advancing.


## Codex Real-Agent Runtime Contract

Any operational path in this workflow that dispatches pipeline work MUST use real Codex `spawn_agent` with a `PIPELINE_AGENT_FQN` marker. If `spawn_agent` is unavailable, fails, or cannot return an isolated agent result, stop with `blocked-no-agent-runtime`. Do not continue inline, do not simulate subagents, and do not report the run as real multi-agent execution.

For informational-only workflows, do not launch the recommended workflow from the help/router context. Recommend the command and stop unless the user explicitly invokes an executable workflow with real agent support.

## Core Mission
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Create complete requirements document aligned with steering context
  - Follow the project's EARS patterns and constraints for all acceptance criteria
  - Focus on core functionality without implementation details
  - Make inclusion/exclusion boundaries explicit when scope could otherwise be misread
  - Update metadata to track generation status

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Gather Context

If steering/spec context is already available from conversation, skip redundant file reads.
Otherwise, load all necessary context:
- Read `pipeline-runs/<run_id>/01-spec/spec.json` for language and metadata
- Read `pipeline-runs/<run_id>/01-spec/brief.md` if it exists (discovery context: problem, approach, scope decisions, boundary candidates)
- Read `pipeline-runs/<run_id>/01-spec/requirements.md` for project description
- Core steering context: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`
- Additional steering files only when directly relevant to feature scope, user personas, business/domain rules, compliance/security constraints, operational constraints, or existing product boundaries
- Relevant local agent skills or playbooks only when they clearly match the feature's host environment or use case and contain domain terminology or workflow rules that shape user-observable requirements

### Step 2: Read Guidelines
- Read `rules/ears-format.md` from this skill's directory for EARS syntax rules
- Read `rules/requirements-review-gate.md` from this skill's directory for pre-write review criteria
- Read `references/spec-templates/requirements.md` for document structure

#### Parallel Research (subagent dispatch)

The following research areas are independent. Decide the optimal decomposition based on project complexity -- split, merge, add, or skip subagents as needed.

**Delegate to subagent via Codex `spawn_agent`** (keeps exploration out of main context; message starts with `PIPELINE_AGENT_FQN: <canonical-fqn>`):
- **Codebase hints** (brownfield projects): Dispatch a subagent to explore existing implementations that inform requirement scope. Example prompt: "Explore this codebase for existing features related to [feature area]. Summarize: (1) what already exists, (2) relevant interfaces/APIs, (3) patterns that new requirements should align with. Return a summary under 150 lines."
- **Domain research** (when external knowledge is needed): Dispatch a subagent for WebSearch/WebFetch to research domain-specific requirements, standards, or best practices. Return a concise findings summary.
- **Additional steering and playbooks**: If many steering files or local agent playbooks exist, dispatch a subagent to scan them and return only the sections relevant to this feature.

For greenfield projects with minimal codebase, skip subagent dispatch and load context directly.

After all research completes, synthesize findings in main context before generating requirements.

### Step 3: Generate Requirements Draft
- Create initial requirements draft based on project description
- Group related functionality into logical requirement areas
- Apply EARS format to all acceptance criteria
- Use language specified in spec.json
- Preserve terminology continuity across phases:
  - discovery = `Boundary Candidates`
  - requirements = explicit inclusion/exclusion and adjacent expectations when needed
  - design = `Boundary Commitments`
  - tasks = `_Boundary:_`
- If scope could be misread, add lightweight boundary context without introducing implementation or architecture ownership detail
- Keep this as a draft until the review gate passes; do not write `requirements.md` yet

### Step 4: Review Requirements Draft
- Run the `Requirements Review Gate` from `rules/requirements-review-gate.md`
- Review coverage, EARS compliance, ambiguity, adjacent expectations, and scope boundaries before finalizing
- If issues are local to the draft, repair the requirements and review again
- Keep the review bounded to at most 2 repair passes
- If the draft exposes a real scope ambiguity or contradiction, stop and ask the user to clarify instead of writing guessed requirements

### Step 5: Finalize and Update Metadata
- Write `pipeline-runs/<run_id>/01-spec/requirements.md` only after the requirements review gate passes
- Set `phase: "requirements-generated"`
- Set `approvals.requirements.generated: true`
- Update `updated_at` timestamp

## Important Constraints

### Requirements Scope: WHAT, not HOW
Requirements describe user-observable behavior, not implementation. Use this to decide what belongs here vs. in design:

**Ask the user about (requirements scope):**
- Functional scope — what is included and what is excluded
- User-observable behavior — "when X happens, what should the user see/experience?"
- Business rules and edge cases — limits, error conditions, special cases
- Non-functional requirements visible to users — response time expectations, availability, security level
- Adjacent expectations only when they change user-visible behavior or operator expectations — what this feature relies on, and what it explicitly does not own

**Do not ask about (design scope — defer to design phase):**
- Technology stack choices (database, framework, language)
- Architecture patterns (microservices, monolith, event-driven)
- API design, data models, internal component structure
- How to achieve non-functional requirements (caching strategy, scaling approach)
- Internal ownership mapping, component seams, or implementation boundaries that belong in design

**Litmus test**: If an EARS acceptance criterion can be written without mentioning any technology, it belongs in requirements. If it requires a technology choice, it belongs in design.

### Other Constraints
- Each requirement must be testable and unambiguous. If the project description leaves room for multiple interpretations on scope, behavior, or boundary conditions, ask the user to clarify before generating that requirement. Ask as many questions as needed; do not generate requirements that contain your own assumptions.
- Choose appropriate subject for EARS statements (system/service name for software)
- Requirement headings in requirements.md MUST include a leading numeric ID only (for example: "Requirement 1", "1.", "2 Feature ..."); do not use alphabetic IDs like "Requirement A".

## Output Description
Provide output in the language specified in spec.json with:

1. **Generated Requirements Summary**: Brief overview of major requirement areas (3-5 bullets)
2. **Document Status**: Confirm requirements.md updated and spec.json metadata updated
3. **Review Gate**: Confirm the requirements review gate passed
4. **Next Steps**: Guide user on how to proceed (approve and continue, or modify)

**Format Requirements**:
- Use Markdown headings for clarity
- Include file paths in code blocks
- Keep summary concise (under 300 words)

## Safety & Fallback

### Error Scenarios
- **Missing Project Description**: If requirements.md lacks project description, ask user for feature details
- **Template Missing**: If template files don't exist, use inline fallback structure with warning
- **Language Undefined**: Default to English (`en`) if spec.json doesn't specify language
- **Incomplete Requirements**: After generation, explicitly ask user if requirements cover all expected functionality
- **Steering Directory Empty**: Warn user that project context is missing and may affect requirement quality
- **Non-numeric Requirement Headings**: If existing headings do not include a leading numeric ID (for example, they use "Requirement A"), normalize them to numeric IDs and keep that mapping consistent (never mix numeric and alphabetic labels).

### Next Phase: Design Generation

**If Requirements Approved**:
- **Optional Gap Analysis** (for existing codebases):
  - Run `/pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:validate-gap {feature}` to analyze implementation gap
  - Recommended for brownfield projects; skip for greenfield
- Run `/pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:spec-design {feature}` to proceed to design phase
- Or `/pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:spec-design {feature} -y` to auto-approve requirements and proceed directly

**If Modifications Needed**:
- Provide feedback and re-run `/pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:spec-requirements {feature}`
