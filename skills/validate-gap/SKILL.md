# validate-gap

## VISIBLE_PLAN Contract

As the first assistant action for this workflow, call `update_plan` so the Codex UI opens the visible planning panel before any workflow/method gate, execution, file edit, dispatch, report generation, validation claim, terminal response, or phase transition. This is mandatory for this workflow and uses `references/visible-plan-contract.md` as the SSOT.

The visible plan must name the selected workflow/mode, declare the planned batches, and track PDD, DDD, ATDD, and TDD or the report-only evidence-first equivalent. Every batch must be followed by checkpoint validation, adversarial review, and a fix loop capped at 3 attempts before continuing. Keep exactly one item `in_progress` and update the plan after every gate, batch, review, correction, and final validation. If the visible plan cannot be opened or updated, stop and surface the blocker instead of proceeding invisibly.

## WORKFLOW_METHOD_GATE Contract

Before any execution, dispatch, file edit, report generation, validation claim, terminal response, or phase transition, show the workflow/method gate defined in `references/workflow-method-gate.md` and wait for the user's answer. State the selected workflow/mode, give the practical reason, and allow switching to `audit`, `bugfix`, `feature`, `ux`, `spec`, `brainstorm`, `review`, or `verify-completion` before continuing.

If the user switches workflow, rebuild the gate and ask again. If the gate cannot be shown or the user does not approve, stop before starting the workflow.

## NEXT_STEP Contract

When this workflow reaches any terminal state, emit the `NEXT_STEP` block defined in `references/workflow-next-step.md`. Use the workflow name from this file's frontmatter as `current_workflow`; if blocked or waiting on the user, point back to the same workflow instead of advancing.

## Role
You are a specialized skill for analyzing the implementation gap between requirements and existing codebase to inform implementation strategy.

## Core Mission
- **Mission**: Analyze the gap between requirements and existing codebase to inform implementation strategy
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Comprehensive understanding of existing codebase patterns and components
  - Clear identification of missing capabilities and integration challenges
  - Multiple viable implementation approaches evaluated
  - Technical research needs identified for design phase

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Gather Context

If steering/spec context is already available from conversation, skip redundant file reads.
Otherwise, load all necessary context:
- Read `pipeline-runs/<run_id>/01-spec/spec.json` for language and metadata
- Read `pipeline-runs/<run_id>/01-spec/requirements.md` for requirements
- Core steering context: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`
- Additional steering files only when directly relevant to the feature's domain rules, integrations, runtime prerequisites, compliance/security constraints, or existing product boundaries
- Relevant local agent skills or playbooks only when they clearly match the feature's host environment or use case and provide analysis-relevant context

### Step 2: Read Analysis Guidelines
- Read `rules/gap-analysis.md` from this skill's directory for comprehensive analysis framework

### Step 3: Execute Gap Analysis

#### Parallel Research

The following research areas are independent and can be executed in parallel:
1. **Codebase analysis**: Existing implementations, architecture patterns, integration points, extension possibilities (using Grep/Glob/Read)
2. **External dependency research**: Dependency compatibility, version constraints, known integration challenges (using WebSearch/WebFetch when needed)
3. **Context loading**: Requirements, core steering, task-relevant extra steering, relevant local agent skills/playbooks, and gap-analysis rules

After all parallel research completes, synthesize findings for gap analysis.

- Follow gap-analysis.md framework for thorough investigation
- Evaluate multiple implementation approaches (extend/new/hybrid)
- Use language specified in spec.json for output

### Step 4: Generate Analysis Document
- Create comprehensive gap analysis following the output guidelines in gap-analysis.md
- Present multiple viable options with trade-offs
- Flag areas requiring further research

### Step 5: Write Gap Analysis to Disk

**Write the gap analysis to disk so it survives session boundaries and can be referenced during design phase.**

- Use the Write tool to save the gap analysis to `pipeline-runs/<run_id>/01-spec/research.md`
- If the file already exists, append the new analysis (separated by a horizontal rule `---`) rather than overwriting previous research
- Verify the file was written by reading it back

## Important Constraints
- **Information over Decisions**: Provide analysis and options, not final implementation choices
- **Multiple Options**: Present viable alternatives when applicable
- **Thorough Investigation**: Use tools to deeply understand existing codebase
- **Explicit Gaps**: Clearly flag areas needing research or investigation
- **Context Discipline**: Start with core steering and expand only with analysis-relevant steering or use-case-aligned local agent skills/playbooks

## Tool Guidance
- **Read first**: Load spec, core steering, relevant local playbooks/agent skills, and rules before analysis
- **Grep extensively**: Search codebase for patterns, conventions, and integration points
- **WebSearch/WebFetch**: Research external dependencies and best practices when needed
- **Write last**: Generate analysis only after complete investigation

## Output Description
Provide output in the language specified in spec.json with:

1. **Analysis Summary**: Brief overview (3-5 bullets) of scope, challenges, and recommendations
2. **Document Status**: Confirm analysis approach used
3. **Next Steps**: Guide user on proceeding to design phase

**Format Requirements**:
- Use Markdown headings for clarity
- Keep summary concise (under 300 words)
- Detailed analysis follows gap-analysis.md output guidelines

## Safety & Fallback

### Error Scenarios
- **Missing Requirements**: If requirements.md doesn't exist, stop with message: "Run `/pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:spec-requirements {feature}` first to generate requirements"
- **Requirements Not Approved**: If requirements not approved, warn user but proceed (gap analysis can inform requirement revisions)
- **Empty Steering Directory**: Warn user that project context is missing and may affect analysis quality
- **Complex Integration Unclear**: Flag for comprehensive research in design phase rather than blocking
- **Language Undefined**: Default to English (`en`) if spec.json doesn't specify language

### Next Phase: Design Generation

**If Gap Analysis Complete**:
- Review gap analysis insights
- Run `/pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:spec-design {feature}` to create technical design document
- Or `/pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:spec-design {feature} -y` to auto-approve requirements and proceed directly

**Note**: Gap analysis is optional but recommended for brownfield projects to inform design decisions.
