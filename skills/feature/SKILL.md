Invoked manually via `/pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:feature [task]`.

# Feature entry-point (v4.7.0)

## VISIBLE_PLAN Contract

Before any execution, file edit, dispatch, report generation, validation claim, or terminal response, call `update_plan` so the user sees the workflow plan in Codex. This is mandatory for this workflow and uses `references/visible-plan-contract.md` as the SSOT.

The visible plan must name the selected workflow/mode, declare the planned batches, and track PDD, DDD, ATDD, and TDD or the report-only evidence-first equivalent. Every batch must be followed by checkpoint validation, adversarial review, and a fix loop capped at 3 attempts before continuing. Keep exactly one item `in_progress` and update the plan after every gate, batch, review, correction, and final validation. If the visible plan cannot be opened or updated, stop and surface the blocker instead of proceeding invisibly.

## NEXT_STEP Contract

When this workflow reaches any terminal state, emit the `NEXT_STEP` block defined in `references/workflow-next-step.md`. Use the workflow name from this file's frontmatter as `current_workflow`; if blocked or waiting on the user, point back to the same workflow instead of advancing.

You are invoking `/pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:feature` — a thin shortcut that delegates to the same `pipeline-controller` agent as `/pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:pipeline`, but with `task_type` pre-fixed to `Feature`.

## Variant override via flag (Slice 3b v4.7.0+)

Before delegating to the controller, inspect `$ARGUMENTS` for a leading variant-override flag. The check is purely additive — invocations without a flag keep the existing auto-classify behavior.

- If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `--light ` (with trailing space) OR `$ARGUMENTS` is exactly `--light`: strip the `--light` prefix and invoke `Skill(skill: "pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:feature-light")` with the remaining `$ARGUMENTS` (may be empty).
- If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `--heavy ` (with trailing space) OR `$ARGUMENTS` is exactly `--heavy`: strip the `--heavy` prefix and invoke `Skill(skill: "pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:feature-heavy")` with the remaining `$ARGUMENTS`.
- Otherwise (no recognized flag): proceed with the controller dispatch below — auto-classification is unchanged.

The `feature-light` and `feature-heavy` skills carry the prescriptive 13-step procedures imported from Pulsar (`D:\Projeto Pulsar\.claude\commands\Prompts\Implement_new_feature\`). Phase 0 (information-gate) and Phase 3 (sanity / final-validator / finishing-branch) still wrap them via `pipeline-controller` when invoked through the auto-classify path.

## What this skill does

Spawn the `pipeline-controller` agent with the user's request prefixed by `PRE_CLASSIFIED_TYPE=Feature`:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:core:pipeline-controller",
  description: "Orchestrate feature pipeline for the user request",
  prompt: "PRE_CLASSIFIED_TYPE=Feature\n\n$ARGUMENTS"
)
```

The controller returns a `PIPELINE COMPLETE` block as its tool result. Show it to the user **verbatim** — do NOT summarize, trim, or paraphrase.

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Does NOT skip information-gate** — gap detection (user story, DoD, scope, integration points) is still mandatory.
- **Does NOT skip design-interrogator** for COMPLEXA features — domain/SSOT/contracts clarity still applies.
- **Does NOT skip per-step gates** — the 4 mandatory AskUserQuestion gates (steps 3, 7, 9, 10) inside the variant skills run regardless of entry path.
- **Does NOT skip sanity check or Pa de Cal** — Phase 3 runs identically (sanity verifies code+tests; Pa de Cal issues GO/CONDITIONAL/NO-GO).
- **Is NOT auto-invoked.** `disable-model-invocation: true` enforces manual-only triggering. Claude will never decide to run this skill on its own — it only runs when the user types `/pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:feature`.

The ONLY phase shortened is Phase 0a (`task-orchestrator`): the classifier accepts `force_type=Feature` (via the `PRE_CLASSIFIED_TYPE` prefix) and skips the type-classification reasoning, but still computes complexity, pipeline_variant, and ssot_status. See `agents/core/task-orchestrator.md` Step 1a.

## Pass-through behavior

The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder captures everything the user typed after the skill name. The full string is passed verbatim to the controller, prefixed by `PRE_CLASSIFIED_TYPE=Feature\n\n`. The controller's Step 1 recognizes the prefix, the `task-orchestrator` Step 1a strips and consumes it, and the rest of the 4-phase pipeline runs identically to a `/pipeline` invocation that classified as Feature.

## Why this exists

Without `/feature`, every "implement X feature" or "add capability Y" request burns one classification round to deduce `type=Feature`. With `/feature`, you tell the controller upfront and it goes straight to scope/user-story gap detection — saves tokens and prevents misclassification as Bug Fix when the user already knows it's a new capability.

The variant-override flags (`--light` / `--heavy`) are the recommended path when the user knows the depth they want: they skip the full pipeline-controller wrapper and run the prescriptive 13-step skill directly.

## Achado #7 GATE_REQUEST handler (2026-05-07+, v5.2.0-rc.2+)

When the dispatched pipeline-controller (or any subagent it transitively dispatches via DISPATCH_REQUEST) returns a tool result containing `=== GATE_REQUEST v1 ===`, `=== DISPATCH_REQUEST v1 ===`, or `=== PLAN_MODE_REQUEST v1 ===` blocks AND ends with `STATUS: AWAITING_GATE_RESPONSES` / `AWAITING_DISPATCH_RESULTS` / `AWAITING_PLAN_MODE_RESULTS`, the parent main LLM MUST process them per `references/gate-request-protocol.md`:

1. Parse each block out of the tool result.
2. For `GATE_REQUEST`: invoke `AskUserQuestion` with the parsed question + options.
3. For `DISPATCH_REQUEST` with `target_kind: agent`: invoke `Agent(subagent_type, description, prompt)`.
4. For `DISPATCH_REQUEST` with `target_kind: skill`: invoke `Skill(skill: target_name)`.
5. For `PLAN_MODE_REQUEST`: invoke `EnterPlanMode`, conduct read-only research, exit with plan.
6. Aggregate responses/results into `GATE_RESPONSES` / `DISPATCH_RESULTS` / `PLAN_MODE_RESULTS` YAML payloads.
7. Re-dispatch the SAME subagent with the original prompt PLUS payloads prepended.
8. Repeat 1-7 until the subagent emits its terminal block (e.g., `PIPELINE COMPLETE`) without AWAITING_*.

Append every block emission and every response to `{PIPELINE_DOC_PATH}/protocol-events.jsonl` (NOT `gate-decisions.jsonl`). Named gates (ADVERSARIAL_GATE, FINAL_ADVERSARIAL_GATE, CLOSEOUT_CONFIRM, TDD_APPROVAL, PLAN_REJECTED, INFO_GATE_BLOCKED) ALSO get a canonical `gate-decisions.jsonl` entry with `decided_by: user` referencing the protocol event id. See `references/gate-request-protocol.md` "gate_id → canonical gate mapping" for the full table.

**Never silently default.** Malformed blocks → present to user via your own `AskUserQuestion` ("malformed block — investigate, retry, or abort?"); do NOT guess.
