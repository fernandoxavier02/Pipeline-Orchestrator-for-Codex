name: audit-heavy
description: Prescriptive 9-step audit workflow for COMPLEXA audits (full system, multi-axis, regulatory, security-sensitive). Imported from Pulsar audit workflow per spec §22. Use when audit complexity is heavy or when audit-light auto-escalates at its scope gate. REPORT-ONLY by Iron Law — no code modification under any circumstance. Steps 1 subagent gate (intake + spec + inventory — REQUIRES SCOPE APPROVAL), 2-4 subagent (architecture + domain/SSOT + contracts via audit-domain-analyzer), 5-8 subagent (data + frontend + backend + governance via audit-compliance-checker), 9 subagent gate (Pa de Cal + risk matrix via audit-risk-matrix-generator — REQUIRES GO/NO-GO). Each step produces a typed JSON output (AuditIntake, DependencyImpactAudit, DecisionSSOTAudit, ContractGovernanceAudit, DataGovernanceAudit, FrontendDeepAudit, BackendDeepAudit, DeliveryGovernanceAudit, AuditMasterSeal). Manual-only invocation via /pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:audit-heavy or via /pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:audit --heavy.

# Audit Heavy Workflow (9 prescriptive steps — REPORT ONLY)

## VISIBLE_PLAN Contract

As the first assistant action for this workflow, call `update_plan` so the Codex UI opens the visible planning panel before any workflow/method gate, execution, file edit, dispatch, report generation, validation claim, terminal response, or phase transition. This is mandatory for this workflow and uses `references/visible-plan-contract.md` as the SSOT.

The visible plan must name the selected workflow/mode, declare the planned batches, and track PDD, DDD, ATDD, and TDD or the report-only evidence-first equivalent. Every batch must be followed by checkpoint validation, adversarial review, and a fix loop capped at 3 attempts before continuing. Keep exactly one item `in_progress` and update the plan after every gate, batch, review, correction, and final validation. If the visible plan cannot be opened or updated, stop and surface the blocker instead of proceeding invisibly.

## WORKFLOW_METHOD_GATE Contract

Before any execution, dispatch, file edit, report generation, validation claim, terminal response, or phase transition, show the workflow/method gate defined in `references/workflow-method-gate.md` and wait for the user's answer. State the selected workflow/mode, give the practical reason, and allow switching to `audit`, `bugfix`, `feature`, `ux`, `spec`, `brainstorm`, `review`, or `verify-completion` before continuing.

If the user switches workflow, rebuild the gate and ask again. If the gate cannot be shown or the user does not approve, stop before starting the workflow.

## NEXT_STEP Contract

When this workflow reaches any terminal state, emit the `NEXT_STEP` block defined in `references/workflow-next-step.md`. Use the workflow name from this file's frontmatter as `current_workflow`; if blocked or waiting on the user, point back to the same workflow instead of advancing.

This skill executes a deterministic 9-step procedure for COMPLEXA audits. The procedure is **non-negotiable**: order is locked, execution mode per step is locked, gates cannot be skipped, and **no production file may be modified at any point**. Every audit agent is read-only by frontmatter and Iron Law.

## When to use this skill

Use **audit-heavy** when ANY of the following hold:

- Audit covers more than 2 axes (e.g., architecture + data + security; or contracts + frontend + backend).
- Audit covers a full system / regulatory boundary (LGPD/GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA).
- Production-grade audit feeding into release gating, due diligence, or compliance review.
- Cross-cutting concerns are involved: persistence, concurrency, multi-user, identity, payment, idempotency, source of truth.
- Baseline available — historical findings to verify, regression to confirm.
- `audit-light` auto-escalated at its step 9 scope gate.

If none of these hold, prefer `audit-light` (same 9 steps, but capped to 1 area / 1 depth level).

## Iron Law — REPORT ONLY

**No step in this skill may create, modify, or delete a production file.** All deliverables are structured reports (Markdown narrative + typed JSON) appended to `.pipeline/audit-runs/<run-id>/` (or equivalent). Audit agents (`audit-intake`, `audit-domain-analyzer`, `audit-compliance-checker`, `audit-risk-matrix-generator`) enforce this in their own frontmatter and prompts.

If at any step the agent finds itself about to write production code or refactor — STOP. The audit reports the issue; remediation is a separate Bug Fix or Feature pipeline run by the user.

## Execution rules (8 enforcement rules — non-negotiable)

These rules are baked into the frontmatter contract. The `dispatch-guard` hook + `sentinel-hook` validate them at runtime. Violations are blocked deterministically.

1. **Sequence lock** — steps execute strictly in order 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9. No skip, no reorder. Validated via `sequence:` + `sequence_lock: true` plus `expected_next:` per step.
2. **Execution-mode lock** — each step declares `execution_mode: subagent`. Cannot be swapped to inline at runtime.
3. **Agent-type whitelist** — when `execution_mode: subagent`, the step declares the EXACT `agent_type:` allowed. `dispatch-guard` rejects any other agent.
4. **Output schema** — each step declares `expected_outputs:`; the next step verifies inputs match before proceeding. Fail-closed.
5. **AskUserQuestion gates obrigatórios** — steps 1 (scope approval) and 9 (Pa de Cal GO/NO-GO) declare `gate_required: true`. The skill MUST invoke AskUserQuestion at those points. Prose substitution is forbidden.
6. **STOP RULE** — 2 consecutive failures (missing inputs, invalid evidence chain, agent timeout) halt the pipeline. `stop_rule_max_failures: 2` enforced by sanity-checker + checkpoint-validator.
7. **Audit log append-only** — every gate decision, AskUserQuestion answer, step transition, and STOP event is appended to `.pipeline/gate-decisions.jsonl`.
8. **Sentinel checkpoints** — `sentinel-hook` validates state coherence before steps 1, 5, 9 (`sentinel_checkpoints: [pre_1, pre_5, pre_9]`). Outside these checkpoints, sentinel blocks execution.

## Iron-Law extension — Read-only enforcement

Beyond the 8 rules above, this skill carries a 9th non-negotiable invariant unique to audit pipelines:

9. **Read-only enforcement** — `report_only: true` in this manifest is mirrored in every step's frontmatter (`production_writes_allowed: false`) and in every audit agent's IRON LAW section. `edit-guard-hook.cjs` rejects any Edit/Write call originating from a step or agent declared read-only. Findings → reports, never patches.

## How execution flows

1. The skill is invoked via `/pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:audit-heavy "<scope description>"` (or via `/pipeline-orchestrator-for-codex:audit --heavy` after pipeline-controller dispatch, or via auto-escalation from `audit-light` step 9).
2. The orchestrator reads `sequence:` and walks the steps.
3. For each step, the orchestrator opens `steps/0X-*.md`, reads the frontmatter, and:
   - spawns a Task with the declared `agent_type:` and passes `expected_inputs` from previous steps
   - the audit agent produces the typed JSON deliverable plus narrative
4. Outputs accumulate; `expected_next` chains the next step.
5. Gates (steps 1 and 9) raise AskUserQuestion before transitioning.
6. On any failure, the STOP RULE may halt the pipeline.

## Gap closures relative to v4.4.x plugin

Before Slice 3a the plugin had the 4 audit agents (`audit-intake`, `audit-domain-analyzer`, `audit-compliance-checker`, `audit-risk-matrix-generator`) and the team-composition references (`references/pipelines/audit-{heavy,light}.md`), but no prescriptive step procedure. The `audit-heavy` reference described WHO runs WHEN; this skill prescribes WHAT each step must produce, in WHAT FORMAT, with WHAT EVIDENCE, and chains them under sequence-lock. Closures:

- **Audit 1 — Intake-as-gate**: scope approval is now a mandatory AskUserQuestion gate at step 1 (was implicit "user blesses scope" in references). Prevents scope creep mid-audit.
- **Audit 2-4 — Architecture/Domain/Contracts as separate steps**: previously bundled under `audit-domain-analyzer` as a single pass. Now three focused invocations, each with its own typed deliverable (DependencyImpactAudit / DecisionSSOTAudit / ContractGovernanceAudit). Reduces context bloat per agent invocation and surfaces issues earlier.
- **Audit 5-8 — Data/Frontend/Backend/Governance as separate steps**: previously bundled under `audit-compliance-checker`. Now four focused invocations (DataGovernanceAudit / FrontendDeepAudit / BackendDeepAudit / DeliveryGovernanceAudit). Same benefit: focused context, parallel-friendly future evolution.
- **Audit 9 — Pa de Cal as GO/CONDITIONAL/NO-GO gate**: previously a free-form synthesis. Now an explicit AskUserQuestion gate with risk-matrix-backed decision and rollback plan for any HIGH-severity finding requiring follow-up.
