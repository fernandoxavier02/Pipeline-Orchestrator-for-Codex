# Gate System Reference

> **SSOT** for gate definitions — hardness taxonomy and the 22-gate registry. `commands/pipeline.md` Grep-redirects here when it needs the full table with trigger conditions and recovery actions. Operational audit mechanics (Phase Transition Summary block template, Gate Decision Log JSONL format + parse/sanitization rules) live in `references/audit-trail.md` — they evolve independently from gate definitions. If you change gate hardness levels or registry rows, update this file; downstream tooling parses it.

## Gate Hardness Taxonomy

Each gate has a formal **hardness** level that determines enforcement behavior:

| Hardness | Meaning | Can be skipped? | User override? | Operational distinction |
|----------|---------|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **MANDATORY** | Never bypassed — not even by `--hotfix` or `--force` flags | No | No | Applies regardless of mode, flags, or user request. Cannot be downgraded. Used for structural integrity (SSOT) and domain-mandated security reviews |
| **HARD** | Blocks until resolved — pipeline waits for resolution | No | No | Can be resolved by user action (answering questions, approving tests, fixing code). Once resolved, pipeline proceeds. Differs from MANDATORY in that HARD gates have a clear resolution path; MANDATORY gates have no "resolve and continue" — they represent invariants |
| **CIRCUIT_BREAKER** | Pipeline stops for safety — requires explicit reset | No | Reset only | Triggered by repeated failures. Pipeline cannot continue without user intervention. **Reset procedure:** user is presented with options: (A) retry from Phase 1.5 with re-planning, (B) retry the failed step with different approach, (C) exit pipeline. User must explicitly choose one. The reset choice is logged to gate-decisions.jsonl with `decision: "RESET"` |
| **SOFT** | Recommended, user can skip with explicit acknowledgment | Yes (logged) | Yes | Always logged when skipped. Skipping applies confidence penalty. Some SOFT gates escalate to HARD when sensitive domains are touched (see Gate Registry) |

## Gate Registry

| Gate | Hardness | Trigger | Action | Recovery |
|------|----------|---------|--------|----------|
| SSOT_CONFLICT | **MANDATORY** | Multiple sources of truth | **TOTAL BLOCK** | User must resolve |
| ADVERSARIAL_GATE_MANDATORY | **MANDATORY** | Batch touches auth/crypto/data | **BLOCK** — cannot skip | Must approve |
| INFO_GATE_BLOCKED | **HARD** | Critical information gap | **BLOCK** Phase 0 | Answer questions |
| TDD_APPROVAL | **HARD** | Tests need approval | **BLOCK** until approved | User approves |
| PLAN_REJECTED | **HARD** | User rejects implementation plan | **RETURN** to Phase 1 | Re-classify or exit |
| COMPLEXITY_GATE | **SOFT** | User overrides classifier (`--simples` on COMPLEXA task, etc.) OR classifier confidence below threshold | **ASK** — confirm override or accept classifier | User confirms override (logged) or accepts classification |
| STOP_RULE | **CIRCUIT_BREAKER** | 2 consecutive failures | **STOP pipeline** | Escalate to user |
| FIX_LOOP_EXHAUSTED | **CIRCUIT_BREAKER** | 3 fix attempts failed | **STOP pipeline** | Propose alternatives |
| STALE_CONTEXT | **SOFT** | `/pipeline continue` with context > 24h | **ASK** — revalidate? | Re-run Phase 0 or proceed |
| MICRO_GATE_GAP | **HARD** | Per-task missing info | **STOP** task | Report gap, ask user |
| CHECKPOINT_FAIL | **HARD** | Build/test fails | Return to executor | Fix and re-validate |
| ADVERSARIAL_BLOCK | **HARD** | Critical findings | Fix loop (max 3) | Fix or escalate |
| ADVERSARIAL_GATE | **SOFT** | Post-checkpoint per batch | **ASK** user (yes/skip/adjust) | Must approve/skip |
| FINAL_ADVERSARIAL_GATE | **SOFT** | Post-sanity, pre-validator | **ASK** user (recommended) | Must approve/skip |
| FINAL_ADVERSARIAL_REWORK | **HARD** | Final adversarial reports CRITICAL findings | **ASK** user (A: fix batch / B: proceed / C: discard) | Fix batch or proceed with penalty |
| CLOSEOUT_CONFIRM | **SOFT** | Push+PR or Discard | **PAUSE** — confirm | User confirms |

### Spec pipeline gates (Wave 5-spec, v4.13.0)

| Gate | Hardness | Trigger | Action | Recovery |
|------|----------|---------|--------|----------|
| SPEC_ARTIFACT_MISSING | **MANDATORY** | Spec detected but one or more required artifacts (requirements.md / design.md / tasks.md) is missing from `.kiro/specs/<id>/` | **TOTAL BLOCK** — list missing artifacts, halt pipeline | User must create missing artifacts before retry |
| SPEC_FORMAT_GATE_FAIL | **HARD** | spec-format-gate agent emits NO-GO (less than 22 of 25 format checks pass) | **BLOCK** — fix spec artifacts and re-run format gate | AskUserQuestion: Edit / Bypass / Abort |
| SPEC_CONTENT_REVIEW_NOGO | **HARD** | spec-content-reviewer (Heavy variant) emits NO-GO (>=1 critical finding) | **BLOCK** Phase 1.5 | AskUserQuestion: Edit / Justified Bypass / Abort |
| SPEC_AC_TRACEABILITY_GAP | **HARD** | quality-gate-router fails to derive >=1 ATDD scenario per Acceptance Criterion (less than 100% AC coverage) | **BLOCK** TDD phase | AskUserQuestion: Add manually / Re-extract / Mark AC non-testable |
| SPEC_POST_IMPL_FAIL | **HARD** | spec-post-impl-validator score below 75% after adversarial loop exhausted | **BLOCK** | AskUserQuestion: New fix batch (1x) / Accept warnings (limited) / Abort |
| ADVERSARIAL_LOOP_CHECKPOINT | **SOFT** (with escalation) | Every 3 fix-loop attempts within a single spec batch without reaching CLEAN adversarial result. Counter resets when batch transitions | **ASK** | AskUserQuestion: Continue (next 3) / Escalate to Heavy variant / Accept warnings / Abort |

> **Note on "SOFT (with escalation)":** the hardness taxonomy describes LEVELS, not GATES. `ADVERSARIAL_LOOP_CHECKPOINT` is fundamentally a SOFT gate (user can continue), but its repeated triggering within a single batch is itself a signal that recovery should escalate (e.g., switch to Heavy variant). The escalation is a recovery-action pattern, not a new hardness level.

### Pipeline routing gates (v5.1.0)

| Gate | Hardness | Trigger | Action | Recovery |
|------|----------|---------|--------|----------|
| STEP_1_7_ROUTING | HARD | Pipeline pre-execution routing decision in STEP 1.7 (load-existing / dispatch-brainstorm / no-prep-override / simples-bypass). | Append entry to gate-decisions.jsonl with the chosen branch. | None — informational. |
| STEP_1_7_RECURSION_GUARD | CIRCUIT_BREAKER | STEP 1.7 entered >=3 times in same pipeline invocation. | Halt pipeline; emit RUN_PARTIAL with cause. | User re-invokes pipeline (no automatic retry). |
| STOP_BEFORE_PA_DE_CAL | HARD | verify-completion returned FAIL before final-validator dispatch. | Skip Pa de Cal; set pipeline status NO-GO; write 04-final-report.md with FAIL details. | User addresses verify-completion findings; re-runs pipeline. |

**Rules (definitions only — operational write mechanics are in `references/audit-trail.md`):**
1. When a SOFT gate is skipped, the decision MUST be logged with `decision: "SKIPPED"`. The `final-validator` MUST check this log and factor skipped gates into the GO/CONDITIONAL/NO-GO decision. (Write path mechanics: see `references/audit-trail.md`.)
